<div style="text-align: justify;">


<p>Hello, hello! I’m Hoa Nguyen, a cryptographer by day and a puzzle enthusiast by night. I’m in the final stages of my PhD, where I explore the art of cryptanalysis and work on optimization techniques. My research focuses on developing automated tools for cryptanalysis, with a particular interest in MILP models. </p>

<p>When I’m not diving deep into cryptography, you’ll likely find me traveling to new places and exploring different cultures. After all, life isn’t just about cracking codes, it’s about discovering the world around us. </p>

<p>If you’re passionate about cryptography, love solving mysteries, or just enjoy nerdy stuff, feel free to reach out. I’d love to connect! </p>
