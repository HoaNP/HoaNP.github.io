👋👋👋

Hello! I’m Hoa Nguyen, a cryptographer by day and puzzle enthusiast by night. I’m wrapping up my PhD, where I explore the art of breaking ciphers with optimization. My work dives into cryptanalysis techniques, ciphers, and the occasional drama of debugging code that doesn’t want to cooperate. 

When I’m not diving deep into cryptography, you’ll find me traveling, learning about new cultures, or tackling a tricky puzzle. Life isn’t all about cracking codes, after all! 

If you’re into cryptography, love solving mysteries, or enjoy chatting about nerdy stuff, feel free to reach out.
