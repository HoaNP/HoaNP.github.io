<div style="text-align: justify;">

<p>Hello, hello! I’m Hoa Nguyen, currently a PhD student in the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/capsule/">CAPSULE team</a> at IRISA, France, under the supervision of <a href="https://people.irisa.fr/Patrick.Derbez/">Patrick Derbez</a>. I am in the final stages of my PhD, where I explore the art of cryptanalysis of symmetric primitives and focus on optimization techniques. My research centers on developing automated tools for cryptanalysis, with a particular interest in using MILP models.</p>

<p>When I’m not diving deep into cryptography, you’ll likely find me traveling to new destinations and exploring diverse cultures. After all, life isn’t just about cracking codes, it’s also about discovering the world around us.</p>
